This repository is a collection of Linux Kernel Modules and relevant documentation focusing on concepts like module information using `MODULE_INFO`, utilizing `modinfo`, and exploring `objdump`. Each directory in this repository illustrates a different aspect or concept related to Linux Kernel Module development.

### 4_modinfo
This directory contains examples and documentation related to using the `modinfo` utility. The `hello.c` file is a simple kernel module, and the `Makefile` is used to compile this module. The `readme.md` in this directory explains how to use `modinfo` to display information about kernel modules.

### 5_using_MODINFO
In this directory, you will find examples illustrating the use of the `MODULE_INFO` macro in kernel modules. The `mod_info.c` is a kernel module showcasing the usage of `MODULE_INFO` to set various metadata. A `Makefile` is provided for compilation, and `readme.md` contains detailed information about `MODULE_INFO`, its usage, and benefits.

### 6_objdump
This directory is dedicated to the exploration and documentation of `objdump`. The `readme.md` in this directory provides comprehensive information and instructions on how to use `objdump` to investigate the object files and gain insights into the binary composition of executables, particularly focusing on kernel modules.
